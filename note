THe basic algorithm of what the program must do :

Use of flags is to determine what must be created 
I (interactive mode)
h (help)
l (list existing loop devices) 
n (number of loop devices)
f (filesystem to be used)
N (Name of the loop device)


(Dependency check)
How many loop device does the user want to create 
Create loop device based on the users input size 
Where to mount the loop device give options (and a default mount directory tmp)
What kind of lvm does the user want to create onto the loop device
Does the user want to add a filesystem on top of this lvm? y or n
IF yes what type of filesystem does he want to create (give options) 
Where does he want to mount the filesystems (give options) 

create a tmp file to save if dependency check were to be happen
create a tmp file to save if dependency check were to be happen
